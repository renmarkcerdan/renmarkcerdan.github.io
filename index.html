					<h2>About me</h2>
					<p>As a passionate and versatile Software Developer, I specialize in building robust web applications using
						PHP (CodeIgniter 3/4, CakePHP 2), JavaScript, jQuery, MySQL, HTML, and CSS. With hands-on experience
						in Git/GitHub and VS Code, I’m comfortable navigating the full development lifecycle—from turning
						business needs into clean, maintainable code to deploying features that deliver real value.
						I’m known for being a fast learner, a problem solver, and a team player who adapts quickly in fast-paced
						environments. Whether I’m working with legacy code or designing new features from scratch, I focus on
						writing efficient, scalable code that meets user needs and exceeds expectations.
						I thrive in collaborative settings where knowledge-sharing and continuous improvement are part of
						the culture. Beyond just coding, I care about the why behind the work—solving real-world problems,
						improving user experiences, and helping teams move faster without sacrificing quality.
						Let’s build something great together.</p>
